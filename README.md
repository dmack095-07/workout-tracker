  ## Description:
  I created a workout tracker for a user to log his/her cardio or resistance exercises for the day. They can log their name, type, weights, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise. 

  ## Installation:
  First install "npm i". Then run "node server.js" to start the application. The user will need to go to http://localhost:3009/ to view the application in the browser.

  ## Usage:
  It can be used to log an exercise routine for the week or a specified amount of time.
